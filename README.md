Store Monitoring API 🚀

A FastAPI backend to monitor store uptime and downtime using store status, business hours, and timezone data. This project provides API endpoints to fetch store information and generate reports.

Features ✨
/ → Welcome message
/stores/status → View store status data (open/closed)
/stores/hours → View business hours for each store
/stores/timezones → View store timezones
/report → Generate uptime/downtime report


Tech Stack 🛠️
Python 3.x
FastAPI – Web framework for APIs
SQLite – Database for storing store data
Pandas – Data processing
Uvicorn – ASGI server for running FastAP

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the API
uvicorn main:app --reload

 Future Improvements 🚀
Real-time monitoring: Integrate WebSockets or a streaming API to update store status in real time.
Authentication & Security: Add API key or OAuth2 authentication to secure endpoints.
Dashboard: Build a frontend dashboard (React/Power BI) to visualize store uptime/downtime.
Automated alerts: Send email or Slack notifications if a store goes down unexpectedly.
Scalability: Move database to PostgreSQL or cloud storage for handling more stores efficiently.
Unit Tests & CI/CD: Add automated tests and continuous deployment workflow to improve reliability.
Data enrichment: Integrate weather or local event data to predict store downtime causes.
